                <h2>Cloud Systems & Microsoft Azure</h2>
                <p>
                    During my internship, I immersed myself in the expansive world of Microsoft Azure, 
                    gaining hands-on experience with its diverse cloud services. I worked extensively 
                    with Azure SQL Server and databases, mastering their configuration and management 
                    to ensure secure and efficient data handling. My experience with Azure Key Vaults 
                    and Managed Identities has equipped me with the knowledge to secure sensitive data 
                    and manage access effectively. I integrated these services with ASP.NET Core and 
                    .NET Framework, and successfully hosted applications on Internet Information Services 
                    (IIS), demonstrating my ability to bridge cloud services with application hosting environments.

                <h2>Blob Storage & Data Management</h2>
                <p>
                    I have developed a deep understanding of Azure Blob Storage, particularly in 
                    managing and securing data. I utilized SAS (Shared Access Signature) tokens 
                    to control access to blob storage, ensuring secure data sharing while maintaining 
                    tight control over user permissions. My work involved setting up and managing 
                    these tokens, which play a critical role in data security and accessibility 
                    within cloud environments.

                <h2>Big Data & ETL Processes</h2>
                <p>
                    My internship provided me with substantial experience in handling large datasets
                    and performing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. Using Python and PowerShell, 
                    I efficiently transformed and loaded data into databases, overcoming challenges such 
                    as irregular line feeds in CSV files. This experience has honed my ability to manage 
                    and process big data, ensuring it is formatted and structured correctly for further 
                    analysis and usage.

                <h2>Automation & Scripting</h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to automate routine tasks using PowerShell scripts, which significantly 
                    reduced manual effort and increased process efficiency. Whether it was automating 
                    backups or deploying applications, my ability to script solutions has been invaluable 
                    in streamlining operations and maintaining consistency across deployments.

                <h2>Application Development & Debugging</h2>
                <p>
                    One of my significant achievements was developing a Zendesk application using JavaScript, 
                    which involved real-time validation of user inputs. This project required not only technical 
                    skills but also a keen eye for detail and a methodical approach to debugging and optimizing 
                    the application. This hands-on experience has reinforced my knowledge of JavaScript and enhanced 
                    my ability to develop robust, user-centric applications.

                <h2>End-to-End Project Involvement</h2>
                <p>
                    My role involved the complete lifecycle of application development, from creating applications 
                    from scratch to deploying them. I actively participated in various projects, each presenting 
                    unique challenges and learning opportunities. This experience has equipped me with the skills 
                    to handle diverse tasks and adapt to different project requirements effectively.

                <h2>Agile Development & Collaboration</h2>
                <p>
                    The internship was conducted in an agile development environment, where I had daily stand-up 
                    meetings with my manager. These meetings were crucial for tracking task progress, receiving 
                    constructive feedback, and making iterative improvements to my work. This agile methodology 
                    has sharpened my project management skills, fostering a proactive approach to problem-solving 
                    and continuous improvement.

                <h2>Virtualization & Server Management</h2>
                <p>
                    Apart from my core tasks, I also took the initiative to set up and manage virtual machines on 
                    Hyper-V for Windows Server. I successfully hosted applications on IIS, gaining practical 
                    experience in server management and virtualization. This initiative not only broadened my 
                    technical skills but also demonstrated my capability to handle additional responsibilities 
                    and explore new technologies.
